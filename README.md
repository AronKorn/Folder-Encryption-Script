# Folder-Encryption-Script
# Use with caution and in a virtual machine only!

The script requires a public key before it can be used.

A script that creates keys can be found here:
https://github.com/AronKorn/Generate-public-key-and-private-key

You select a folder, the script encrypts all the files within it, and then deletes the unencrypted files.

In the first step, you specify the path to the folder you wish to encrypt.

Then you specify the path to the public key file.
